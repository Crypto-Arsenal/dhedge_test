# dHEDGE Interaction Script

This Node.js script demonstrates how to interact with the dHEDGE decentralized finance platform using the `@dhedge/v2-sdk`. It involves creating an investment pool, adding liquidity, and performing a trade on SushiSwap within the Arbitrum network.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system (Node.js 14.x or higher recommended).
- An account with a blockchain provider like Infura that supports Arbitrum.
- A basic understanding of Node.js and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository or Download the Script:**

   If available, clone the repository using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
   Or download the script directly into your project directory.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install necessary Node.js packages:
   ```bash
   npm install @dhedge/v2-sdk ethers
   ```
3. **Update the Script to Use Environment Variables:**

   Ensure your script `dhedge.ts` retrieves the environment variables:
   ```typescript
   require('dotenv').config(); // at the top of your file

   const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
   const providerUrl = process.env.PROVIDER_URL;
   ```

   Install the dotenv package to load the environment variables:
   ```bash
   npm install dotenv
   ```

4. **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:**

   Compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript if necessary, using the TypeScript compiler:
   ```bash
   npx tsc dhedge.ts
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Execute the Script:**

   Run the compiled JavaScript file or the TypeScript file directly (if using ts-node):
   ```bash
   node dhedge.ts
   ```


2. **Monitor Output:**

   Watch the console for logs indicating the execution of transactions such as pool creation, liquidity addition, and trading operations.

## Important Notes

- **Security:** Keep your private keys secure and never expose them in publicly accessible areas. The use of `.env` for sensitive information helps avoid hard-coding credentials in your source files.
- **Gas Limits:** The script sets high gas limits to ensure transactions do not fail. Monitor and adjust these values based on actual transaction requirements.
- **Error Handling:** Enhanced error handling is implemented to manage and log exceptions effectively.
